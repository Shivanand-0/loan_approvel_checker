# Loan Approval Checker

A machine-learning-based application to predict whether a loan should be approved, built with a backend ML model and a frontend interface.

## Project Overview

This application aims to assist lenders (or applicants) by providing an automated check whether a loan application is likely to be approved, using historical data and a trained machine learning model.  
It consists of two parts:  
- A **machine-learning model** (in the `mlModel/` folder)  
- A **frontend interface** (in the `frontend/` folder) for users to input application data and view results.

## Features

- Upload or manually enter applicant data (e.g., income, credit score, loan amount)  
- Predict approval status (e.g., “Approved” / “Not Approved”) using the trained model  
- View feature importance or model explanation (if implemented)  
- Easily extend the model, update data, retrain, and deploy
